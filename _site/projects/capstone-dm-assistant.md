This project served as my Capstone for my final semester of my studies at Durham College. Our Capstone had to be a cumulative representation of the knnowledge we had gained from the program, as well as implement technologies that we were both familliar, and unfamilliar with. I chose to develop a desktop application to help in running a Dungeons and Dragons game.

The application runs on the Unity game engine and utilizes a noSQL JSON database for CRUD operations. Both of these technologies were foreign to me at the beginning of the project, but by the end, I was quite proficient in both. Seeing as I used the Unity Engine to develop, the application runs on C# and JSON and used the Unity pre-built UI elements.

The purpose of the application is to assist the Dungeon Master, the person who directs a Dungeons and Dragons game, in the creation and operation of the game, allowing them to prepare sessions faster, and run them smoother. Current features of the application include:

1. Creation of Encounter Tables
2. A full index of the Monster Manual
3. Creation of both Player and NPC Characters

This project was also presented at the Durham College IT Expo, where I ran a panel demonstrating the application to Expo guests. The project received overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 100% in my guest reviews.

This is also an ongoing project, I have several new features that I am implementing in my free time. I have also begun development of a mobile application, featuring simplified features of this project.
