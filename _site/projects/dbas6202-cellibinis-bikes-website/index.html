            <p><strong>Project:</strong> DBAS6202 - Cellibini's Bike Shop Website<br>
<strong>Completed:</strong> Semester 5 by Blade Lucas<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> This group project had us working a full SDLC, where I was the lead developer and created the solution using PHP/Laravel.</p>
<p>In our semester 5 Adanced Database course, we were given a business case that we had to work on throughout the entire semester. Starting from the beginning, we had to everything from requirements gathering and project proposals, through to a final presentation of a fully developed project to a panel of clients (played by our professors). This was a group project where I worked alongside 3 others and we were all assigned different roles within the project to simulate a workplace environment. My role within the project was lead developer and I chose to use PHP and the Laravel framework to develop the solution.</p>
<p>Our business case was a local bike shop owner, Cellibini, had been running his small bike shop for years, but recently had an influx of business. His current business model was entirely on paper, and his staff took care of sales, as well as bike manufacturing. Our task was to develop a website allowing him to move his business to the online market, as well as a relational database to handle stock and manufacturing needs. Additionally, we were asked to make a staff portal to assist in the day to day operations of the business, everything from management to manufacturing.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, we carefully developed a plan for this business case, developing a sales front website which allowe customers to create accounts, place orders for pre-built bikes or individual parts, and access their account history. Through the website there was also a secure staff portal which, depending on the position of the staff member, would allow different levels of access to company functions. All of this was linked to a relational SQL database which managed every aspect of the business.</p>
<p>As a group, we received a very high mark on this assignment, as we impressed the entire panel of clients during our final presentation and we had a fully functional and asthetically pleasing website.</p>
