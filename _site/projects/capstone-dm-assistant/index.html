            <p><strong>Project:</strong> Capstone - D&amp;D Dungeon Master Assistant<br>
<strong>Completed:</strong> Semester 6 by Blade Lucas<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> This was my capstone project for my final semester of the Computer Programming and Analysis program at Durham College where I developed a utility desktop application for a game using C#, Unity and JSON.</p>
<p>This project served as my Capstone for my final semester of my studies at Durham College. Our Capstone had to be a cumulative representation of the knnowledge we had gained from the program, as well as implement technologies that we were both familliar, and unfamilliar with. I chose to develop a desktop application to help in running a Dungeons and Dragons game.</p>
<p>The application runs on the Unity game engine and utilizes a noSQL JSON database for CRUD operations. Both of these technologies were foreign to me at the beginning of the project, but by the end, I was quite proficient in both. Seeing as I used the Unity Engine to develop, the application runs on C# and JSON and used the Unity pre-built UI elements.</p>
<p>The purpose of the application is to assist the Dungeon Master, the person who directs a Dungeons and Dragons game, in the creation and operation of the game, allowing them to prepare sessions faster, and run them smoother. Current features of the application include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creation of Encounter Tables</li>
<li>A full index of the Monster Manual</li>
<li>Creation of both Player and NPC Characters</li>
</ol>
<p>This project was also presented at the Durham College IT Expo, where I ran a panel demonstrating the application to Expo guests. The project received overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 100% in my guest reviews.</p>
<p>This is also an ongoing project, I have several new features that I am implementing in my free time. I have also begun development of a mobile application, featuring simplified features of this project.</p>
