For one of my projects in my Mobile Development course, I worked alongside a partner to create a Battleship game using the Dart programming language in conjunction with Flutter.

Although I was in a group for this project, I ended up doing the vast majority of the project on my own, but over the course of the development process, I became very familliar and comfortable with dart development. I spent a lot of time pouring over the dart and flutter documentation, learning how to manipulate widgets and integrate logic.

The app features 5 screens, which was the requirement of the project, a Home Screen, a settings screen, a game setup screen, a game screen, and a victory/defeat screen (depending on the outcome of the game). The game featured a basic A.I enemy for the player to face off against, the basis of the AI logic was to fire randomly at positions they hadnt fired at before, until they got a hit. From there the AI would store the location of the last hit and fire around that tile, keeping in mind the cardinal direction of the previous hit, until they sink a ship, then they start firing randomly again until the next hit.

The project ended up being a huge success. We received a 100% on the final grade.
