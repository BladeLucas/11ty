            <p><strong>Project:</strong> INFT3101 - D&amp;D Assistant Mobile Application<br>
<strong>Completed:</strong> Semester 7 by Blade Lucas<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> This mobile application was an extension of my Capstone project developed in dart/flutter.</p>
<p>Another mobile development project I worked on during a Victory Lap at Durham after I graduated was an extension of my Capstone Project. I took the principles of my D&amp;D Dungeon Master Assistant desktop application, and simplified some of the functions into a mobile application.</p>
<p>Much like my semester 5 mobile project, this application required 5 screens, I chose to work on this project alone though, rather thwan in a group. Once again, this project used the dart programming language with flutter.</p>
<p>The 5 screens I built into the application are a Home screen and settings screen again, as those are fairly standard for any app. I also made a Dice screen, where the user may roll any number of any type of dice and get the results. I also made a Character List screen which directed to either a Character ceration page or a character viewing screen, depending on the navigation button the user pressed.</p>
<p>As this was meant to be an extension of my Capstone project, I once again went with a noSQL JSON approach, that way files generated by the desktop application can be transfered and read by the application in future development. I also had to leverage several flutter lobraries in order to access local data on a mobile device to ensure the JSON file would not be wiped every time the app was exited.</p>
<p>Once again, on this project I managed to receive a 100% grade, and this is a project that I will continue to develop, along with my Capstone, in my free time.</p>
